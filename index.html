    <h1>Privacy Policy for CV Resume Maker</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the <strong>CV Resume Maker</strong> mobile application ("App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the App. This privacy policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by Faisal ur Rehman.</p>

    <h2>1. Personal Data</h2>
    <p><strong>CV Resume Maker does not collect any personal data from its users.</strong> All information that users input into the App, such as names, contact details, work experience, education, skills, and other resume-related content, is stored exclusively on the user's device and is not transmitted to or stored on any server controlled by Faisal ur Rehman.</p>
    <p>The App does not require users to register an account or provide any personal information to use its core features. Your resume data is yours and remains private to your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Non-Personal Data and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>While the App itself does not collect personal data, it does utilize third-party services that may collect anonymized, non-personal data for purposes such as analytics, crash reporting, and advertising. These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>2.1. Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google AdMob, an advertising service provided by Google Ireland Limited. AdMob may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect data for personalized advertising. This data is typically non-personal and includes information such as device identifiers, IP addresses, and usage data. This is done to provide relevant advertisements.</p>
    <p>For more information on how AdMob collects and processes data, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>2.2. Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics)</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google Firebase, a development platform provided by Google. Specifically, Firebase is used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> To understand how users engage with the App, such as app usage patterns, session duration, and feature engagement. This data is anonymized and helps improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To collect crash reports, which helps in identifying and fixing bugs and improving the App's stability. Crash reports contain technical information about the crash but do not include personal user data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how Firebase collects and processes data, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security (User-Generated Content)</h2>
    <p>As stated in Section 1, all resume content and personal details you enter into the CV Resume Maker app are stored locally on your device. Faisal ur Rehman does not have access to this data. The security of your data depends on the security of your device and any backup solutions you use (e.g., iCloud backups).</p>
    <p>When you choose to export or share your resume (e.g., as a PDF), the App utilizes standard iOS sharing functionalities. Any data shared or exported through these channels will be subject to the privacy policies of the respective third-party services (e.g., email providers, cloud storage services like iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox if the user chooses to save there).</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The CV Resume Maker App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to instruct their children never to give out personal information without their permission.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Faisal ur Rehman reserves the right to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the non-personal information we collect via third-party services. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
