        </h1>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-sm">This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the <strong>CV Preparation: Resume Builder</strong> mobile application ("App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the App. This privacy policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by Faisal ur Rehman.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: Personal Data -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-app-gold mt-8 mb-4">1. Personal Data and Local Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>CV Preparation: Resume Builder does not collect any personal data from its users.</strong> All information that users input into the App, such as names, contact details, work experience, education, skills, and other resume-related content, is **stored exclusively on the user's device** and is not transmitted to or stored on any server controlled by Faisal ur Rehman.</p>
        <p>The App does not require users to register an account or provide any personal information to use its core features. Your resume data is yours and remains private to your device.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Non-Personal Data and Third-Party Services -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-app-gold mt-8 mb-4">2. Third-Party Services and Data Processing</h2>
        <p>While the App itself does not collect personal data, it does utilize third-party services that may collect anonymized, non-personal data for purposes such as analytics, crash reporting, and the operation of AI features and advertising. These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

        <!-- 2.1 Gemini API (NEW) -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-app-gold mt-6 mb-3">2.1. AI Services (Google Gemini API)</h3>
        <p>The App uses the **Google Gemini API** to power intelligent features, including generating career objectives, skill summaries, and personalized interview questions based on your CV content.</p>
        <p>When you use the 'Generate with AI' feature, the relevant, user-provided text content (e.g., job title, project descriptions) from your locally stored CV is **temporarily transmitted** to the Gemini API for processing. The generated AI response is then returned to your device.</p>
        <p class="text-sm border border-app-gold p-3 rounded-lg mt-3">
            <strong>Data Handling:</strong> We only transmit the minimum necessary text content required to generate the AI response. We **do not store** this transmitted content on any server controlled by us, and we adhere strictly to the Gemini API usage policies regarding user privacy.
        </p>
        
        <!-- 2.2 Google AdMob (renumbered) -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-app-gold mt-6 mb-3">2.2. Google AdMob</h3>
